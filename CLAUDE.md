# agent-runtime

Shared task-lifecycle skeleton for domain agents, generated agents, red-team harnesses, and coding agents. Standardizes the lifecycle (`runAgentTask`, `runAgentTaskStream`); delegates domain behavior to adapters.

Imports `@tangle-network/agent-eval` for the control loop, knowledge readiness scoring, and run-record types. Does not own domain policy, models, tools, connectors, or UI.

## Authorship

Do not add `Co-Authored-By:` trailers (or any other AI-attribution lines) to commits, PR descriptions, or other artifacts in this repo. Author = the human running the session. Applies to every contributor, including AI agents and subagents — do not include the default Claude Code template trailer.

## Comment & doc discipline (no historical narrative)

Comments describe **what the code does and why** — never what it used to do, what it replaced, which audit found a bug, or what the prior version looked like. History belongs in commit messages and PR descriptions, not the source tree.

- Bad: `// replaces the inline retry loop`, `// fix for the silent-zero bug`, `// the 2yr rewrite added this`, `// audit fix`
- Good: `// value: null when retries exhaust — callers must inspect succeeded`

Applies to docstrings, README sections, SKILL.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md — anywhere the source tree carries prose.

## No fallbacks. Fail loud.

Sloppy fallbacks corrupt every signal downstream. No silent zeros, no `?? default` on required fields, no `try/catch { return null }` that erases diagnostic info, no legacy back-compat mode defaulted on for new code.

External-boundary calls (LLM, network, FS, subprocess) return *typed outcomes* (`{ succeeded, value, error }`). Callers MUST inspect `succeeded` before using `value`. Named, opted-in fallback rotations (`policy.fallbackModels: [...]`) are fine; deep `?? "kimi"` helpers are not.

Full doctrine: `~/dotfiles/claude/AGENTS.md` → "No fallbacks. Fail loud."
